# Metropolitan Medical

Metropolitan Medical web app project, commissioned by Dr. Camelie Bowen.

This project involves developing a web application for clients to schedule appointments with Dr. Bowen’s practice. These scheduled appointments would automatically integrate with her email and Google Calendar. Additionally, the web app would feature a blogging platform where Dr. Bowen could share insights on various medical topics related to women’s health. This functionality would be supported by a WordPress backend, with specific endpoints exposed to the main application for seamless integration.


 
**Unfortunately my client got too distracted and the poor project stalled, at the finish line no less :(
The project is abandoned by this point lol**
