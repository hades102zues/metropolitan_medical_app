# Metropolitan Medical

Metropolitan Medical web app project, commissioned by Dr. Camelie Bowen.

This project was meant to provide Dr. Bowen with a web application where she could accept and schedule client appointments via email and Google calendar integration for her practice. 

Additonally, it was to act as a blogging platform for her to discuss various medical topics affecting women's health. This would have been facilitated by a word press backend with some endpoints exposed to the main application.


 
**Covid Era came with some business adjustments and life changes. Ultimately, it was decided to halt the development process and launch. 
The project is abandoned by this point lol**
